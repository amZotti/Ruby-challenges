My goal for this Ruby challenge is to practice using Ruby's builtin testing. I
recently took the Ruby course on CodeSchool and learned MiniTest
and want to use this to improve my skills in it.

Challenge:
Create an any? method that accepts an array and a block, and returns true if the block returns true for any item in the array. If the array is empty, the method should return false.
