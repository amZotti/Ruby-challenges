1) Test Driven Development using Rspec
--------------------------------------
Rspec is a testing library for Ruby. With Rspec we are testing behavior, not
methods. We use the commands 'describe' and 'context' to initiate a test. 

Example: (Thanks to teamtreehouse)

describe Hash do
  it "should return a blank instance" do
    Hash.new.should == {}
  end
end

To execute a test you can type the following from terminal:
rspec filename.rb


2) Directives
-------------
Directives are basicall options which tell a program how to run. In AngularJS we
use directives in our HTML, to tell Angular how to interpret the JS methods we
are calling on it. In general directives do not do anything, but rather tell the
compiler how to interpret the code it is presented.
